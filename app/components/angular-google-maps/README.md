AngularJS directives for the Google Maps Javascript API. Quite different from AngularUI's take on it. Up to you to decide what suits your needs.

Please see the example in the tree. And be sure to [RTFM](http://nlaplante.github.io/angular-google-maps "read the documentation")!

Pull requests more than welcome! Enjoy!
